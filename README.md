# WeatherForecast  
 - Project Scenario:  
   
   The team at a European travel agency is trying to increase travel bookings. To do this, they want to provide an ability for their website visitors to look up a 7 day weather forecast for major European cities.  
   They want me to create a webpage that will retrieve weather forecasts from an external service. This feature will help the agency maximize their travel bookings and sales through their website.  
     
 - Project Objectives:  

   1) Provide ability for website users to look up 7 day weather forecasts for major European cities  
   2) Keep website visitors on the website longer  
   3) Increase online bookings  
 - The Challenge:  

    The challenge will be to write a webpage that uses API to retrieve weather information from an external source. To do this, i will create the user interface, send the request to the external source using JavaScript, process data received and present the information on your webpage using HTML.  
    In this project, i'll use 7Timer API, which is free of charge and does not require any API keys.
